# The largest Awesome List of command line (CLI/TUI) programs

This repository - to the best of my knowledge - contains the largest collection of command line (CLI/TUI) tools available in the form of awesome list.
With source information maintained in a handy CSV file.

To contribute, see the [contribution section](#contribute).
Read the instructions before rushing at changing the README file: you must edit the CSV files, not the README!

Some links are available to [related resources](#resources).
